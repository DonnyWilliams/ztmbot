# ztmbot
This is a Twitter bot I built in Zero To Mastery Academy's Complete Python Developer in 2021 class.

tweettweet.py is an introduction to using Twitter's API. It does a few basic things, like follow someone, search for specific keywords, etc.
likesomethingrandom.py does what it says; it likes automatically likes tweets based on a keyword or phrase.
